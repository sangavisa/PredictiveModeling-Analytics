# Cyber Threat Detection using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to detect and classify cyber threats using a labeled dataset. It uses a visual workflow to perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## üß† Project Overview

The project includes:

- Loading and preparing a cyber threat dataset
- Selecting and transforming relevant fields
- Partitioning the dataset into training and testing sets
- Training classification models (e.g., Decision Tree - C&R Tree)
- Evaluating and analyzing the model's performance
- Comparing different model setups and feature combinations

## üîç Key Components

- **Dataset:** `cyber_threat_sample.csv` (or similarly structured file)
- **Tool Used:** IBM SPSS Modeler (visual workflow platform)
- **Main Elements:**
  - Field selection and transformation
  - Partitioning for training/testing
  - Model training using C&R Tree
  - Analysis and visualization of results
